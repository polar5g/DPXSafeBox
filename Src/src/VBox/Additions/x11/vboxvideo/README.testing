This file contains some notes about things to try out to give the X.Org video
driver a reasonably thorough test.  We will add cases of things which have been
known to fail in the past to this file as we discover them.

 * Test XFree86 guests (CentOS 3), early X.Org (CentOS 5) and recent
   (CentOS 6 and 7, current Ubuntu/Fedora).  Test Solaris guests (10 and 11?).
 * Dynamic resizing should work, on CentOS 6 and later Linux guests it should
   work without VBoxClient running.
 * Disabling and enabling virtual screens (VBoxManage in 4.3).
 * Dynamic resizing with one of more virtual screens disabled.
 * Test switching to virtual terminals and back from windowed, full screen and
   seamless modes (seamless currently only works properly with VBoxClient
   running).
 * Test switching directly between normal, full-screen, seamless and scaled
   modes.
 * execute "xprop -root | grep VBOX" after resizing a screen: VBOX_SIZE_HINTS
   should be set, and VBOX_SIZE_HINTS_MISMATCH should equal 0 on CentOS 6 and
   later (4.4 and later).
 * Test re-ordering the virtual screen using the native guest operating system
   tools and make sure that mouse integration still works as expected.
 * Test disabling and re-enabling guest screens with the native system tools.
 * Try disabling and re-enabling mouse integration and check that capturing
   works with multiple guest screens.
 * Shutting down and re-starting a virtual machine should restore the last size
   for all monitors (note: currently only after log-in).  Full shut-down, not
   a reboot.
 * Test power management by disabling guest screens ("xrandr --output VGA-n
   --off") and re-enabling them ("xrandr --output VGA-n --preferred --pos XxY")
   where X and Y are the position of the screen before disabling it.
 * Test sending video mode hints with screen position information via
   VBoxManage.  The screen position is a hint only.  The approximate position
   should be preserved after a shut down and re-start of the guest.
 * Test re-starting the X server after resizing all guest windows.  The server
   should not crash.
